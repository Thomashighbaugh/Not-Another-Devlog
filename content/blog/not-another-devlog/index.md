'Oh God, not another devlog?!'

No, dear reader, this is not another devlog. This is my (TLH) devlog, meaning that like everything else that involves 
yours truly, I will be importing my unique bombast and tone to all of the articles here. 

## Purpose 

The purpose of this blog is not merely proving my React/Gatsby/SCSS/Design prowess but also to create articles that are 
relevant and understandable to someone who is new to technology, specifically to the process of developing web applications
or using Linux as their primary OS. 

## About Me

I am an autodidactic web developer and Linux fanatic from beautiful Hayward, California with a passion for technology that
emerged in my infinite frustration with Microsoft at a time when I was gravely ill and had nothing better to do than 
find and pursue some passion, which started for me as Linux installations and then configurations and has slowly morphed 
into what is today intersecting topics related to web technologies and Linux desktop/server/whatever environments. 

Outside of my constant working on projects, or articles, I also spend a lot of time walking around with my dog. This precious 
canine bonding time being the only time I can get tech off my brain, so long as my phone is working and Spotify decides 
to play nice.
